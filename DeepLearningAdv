The emerging technology that i chose for my writing prompt is Deep Learning. AI supports deep learning by allowing information to be processed faster, data is easier to graph and a more efficient process of elimination of unwanted data.
Deep Learning has been reinforced by AI to retain massive amounts of data in shorter summarized sequences. Before AI, Deep Learning relied heavily on computing proccesors that would get bogged down from too much data.
AI has sped up the process by using less trial and error based solution thinking and utilizing machine learning to give adaptable variables as its computing vs having to wait until a sequence was finished to upload a new data set
Computer vision has adapted rapidly due to advancements in AI which allow for better results with image recognition that can allow software to tell the difference between objects in some applications quicker than humans
With Machine Learning there was a limted amount of data that could be recognized in the same period of time this application made deep learning models necesscary for applications such as self driving vehicles, drones , marketing data.
This key difference is why deep learning models are being used in many different applications outside of what was previously listed we have also found it to be useful in healthcare, bioengineering as well as personal assistants
Due to the AI being able to train the data it has a more effiecient input and output which can be scaled and trained to meet the needs of many walks of life.
From just using siri to set a simple timerto wake you up. To asking chat gpt to create an gameplan for a football team that wouldnt allow a defensive cooridinator to adjust to the play style. To setting up a automated vacuum machine.
