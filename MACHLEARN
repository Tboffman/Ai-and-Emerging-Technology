In Machine Learning there are 7 commonly used steps to produce a soultion or output.
Defining the problem and identifying the goal is one of the issues id like to speak on today. During my research i found that if this first step is not throughly examined then the bias my not have enough range to clearly define what the task is at hand
This factor is important due to certain applications that may desire to integrate machine learning tools but feel they might have failed before. If there is not a strong enough data set then the model will not be able to accurately determine the goal in computer vision and other image detection.
If a model is incorrectly trained the models data will not be accurate to the data in the case study. Lets say x is our input which can be color y will be the shape of whats holding the liquid. Pop in a cup vs juice in a bottle. The established model set will have to be trained with mulitple images.
If the images are not evaulated on images outside of the training model the training model might select a unidentified bias. Prepation of data is a very important key in making sure that there are enough trained variables to make a desicion similar to that of a human mind can make.
This application is already in as it can be used for a freestyle pop machine at fast food restaurants. Another example could be for security authentication by second hand authentication companies when asked to pick the pictures the have a said item in the picture. (ie "select all the images that have a car to prove your human") ( Face ID on a Cell Phone or Computer)
Ethical concerns that still need to be addressed are how much power we give to these applications and the guidelines for developers that are training the data. If someone tried to use machine learnings applications for something like when police cams were initiated during a traffic stop there would be a descepency becuase of the data needed to make this desicion
